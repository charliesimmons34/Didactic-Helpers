There are many game possibilities using this program. Here is one possibility:

"GUESS THE SENTENCE"

A phrase is written on the board, as a series of dashes (similar to hangman):

_ _   _ _ _ _   _ _   _ _ _

Students are separated into 2-5 teams. The game begins, and team by team, a student comes up to the front of the classroom and presses the spacebar on the computer. The following outcomes are possible:

10 points: The team guesses a letter. For every instance of the letter in the sentence, the team receives 10 points. The game continues with the next team.

20 points: The team guesses a letter. For every instance of the letter in the sentence, the team receives 20 points. The game continues with the next team.

30 points: The team guesses a letter. For every instance of the letter in the sentence, the team receives 30 points. The game continues with the next team.

40 points: The team guesses a letter. For every instance of the letter in the sentence, the team receives 40 points. The game continues with the next team.

-50 points: The team loses the turn, and 50 points are subtracted from their total score. The game continues with the next team.

LOSE TURN: The team loses the turn. The game continues with the next team.

The game ends when the sentence is solved. When it is a team's turn, members have the chance to call out "We want to solve!" at the beginning of the round. If the sentence is solved correctly, the team wins a previously chosen number of points (say, 100 points), and a new game begins. Scores can be carried through if desired.

A purchasing price can be set for vowels, if desired.
